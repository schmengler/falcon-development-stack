# Deity Falcon Development Stack
This is a collection of docker containers to run the development environment of Deity Falcon.
All the code you lwill be working on is installed on mounts on your host system. Git push and pull commands should be doen from the hosts system.

This is definetly not a production setup. The hosts are not configured for speed or security.


## Prerequisites 
- Installed and working GIT setup, with ssh-key/credentials for gitHub. 
- Installed and working `docker` setup. Make sure that your Docker service is up and running.
- Installed and working `docker-compose` setup. Make sure that it is version 3, so it matches the `docker-compose.yml` file of this project.
- auth.json file with the composer credentials to access the magento repository **(this file will be copied into the docker image)**

## Operating systems 

The current setup is only tested on Linux. 
* MacOS users who would like to try using it, should probably think of using a docker sync tool for all the mounted volumes. 
* Windows users who would like to try using it , should probably think of using named volumes for the code. use a samba Server or SSH acces to modify your files.

## Installation 
1) Clone this git repository to your local system.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:deity-io/falcon-development-stack.git
```

2) Change the current working directory to the root folder.
```bash
$ cd ./falcon-development-stack
```

3) Copy your composer `auth.json` file to project dir 
```bash
$ cp ~/.config/composer/auth.json .
```

4) Run `bin/build.sh` to build the images.
```bash
$ ./bin/build.sh
```

5) After the build, bring up the containers using 
```bash
$ ./bin/up.sh
```

# Additional commands

### Purge build 
Removes all build info from the host system. but leaves the docker images intact
the 2 database voluems created arn't removed by this command. do this manlually if you need to whipe that data.
```bash
$ bin/purge.sh
```

### Shortcut for starting Deity
Shortcut to start stack and the Node data server `deity_project`.
```bash
$ bin/up.sh
```


# Multi-project environment

Current development stack supports "multi-project" environment.

Docker-Compose will add a prefix to container names automatically (taken from your project folder name),
this way - you can clone this project to any folder and start the project without having any conflicts
with container names.

# Presistent data 
The code and the databases are sored on "named volumes"
In a linux setup the code folders  will be maped to `./src`
The database folders are just named volumes. They wil reactach when needed. Please note before a rebuild, you might want to drop these named folders from your docker instance 
```bash
$ docker volume rm  [stack_name]_magento_db_data
$ docker volume rm  [stack_name]_wordpress_db_data
```

# Technical debt 
* split deity-falcon client and server to different host (currently the client doesn't support this, update is pending)
* server configuration default.json is a full copy. overwriting specific values isn't supported yet
* debugging Node.js server not working on falcon- client (ticket created)
* node.js server debugging, cant set port trugh settings. Wont be a problem when running on seperate containers
* Mongo and Redis are un-used 
* Magento 2 default install to "current" and switch to "development"
* Magento 2 use redis for Page and defautl cache
* Magento 2 use redis for session server
* Wordpress use redish for session server
* Mac and Windows users will have a bad time with mounted volumes
* Mac's currently dont suppoort mounting the authentication agent socket. (update is planed)
* Windows will probably never suppoort mounting the authentication agent socket
* add status/info pages for redish
* add nginx (single entry point) to proxy all date to correct servers 
* check out HAproxy over nginx
* provide environment file for externbal port mappings
* provide option to switch between main/nightly builds / magento developement environment
* Add Mailhog as default Server for Sendmail (All mails not send from Wordpress or Magento)
